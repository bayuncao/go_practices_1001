After consulting numerous books, podcasts, blogs, open source books, and online documentation on the Internet, I've summarized and distilled them into 10 Topics, each of which summarizes 101 Points.","I've tried to make Go Practices 1001 inclusive of important points of interest that may exist along all paths from introductory to advanced, and of course I'd love for you to provide additional sources of information to build Go Practices 1001 together.","For Golang developers at different stages and skill levels, 1001 may contain what you need. Of course, the Golang language is constantly evolving, so hopefully we can continue to evolve and practice optimization with Golang.","If you have a quality online resource that is beyond the scope of this document, please send it to me via email ( bayuncao@gmx.com) and I will summarize and update it as soon as I read it (usually no more than 48 hours)."]}]]
